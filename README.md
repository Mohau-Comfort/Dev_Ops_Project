# 🚀 DevOps Crash Course Project

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **DevOps project**, created while following a hands-on DevOps crash course.  
The goal of this project is to **learn and apply core DevOps concepts** by working with a full-stack application and automating development, deployment, and operations workflows.

This project focuses on understanding **how modern DevOps practices are used in real-world systems**, rather than just theory.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aim to:

- Understand the role of DevOps in a full-stack application
- Learn how to manage source code using Git & GitHub
- Build and automate CI/CD pipelines
- Containerize applications using Docker
- Understand Kubernetes basics for container orchestration
- Explore Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts
- Deploy APIs in an automated and repeatable way

---

## 🧠 What This Project Covers
This project follows a DevOps crash course that covers:

- **Git & GitHub** – version control and collaboration  
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – automating build, test, and deployment workflows  
- **Docker** – containerizing applications  
- **Kubernetes** – managing and running containers at scale  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** – defining infrastructure programmatically  
- **API Deployment** – deploying and managing backend services  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools (Growing)
As I progress through the course, this project will include hands-on usage of:

- Git & GitHub
- CI/CD tools (e.g. GitHub Actions)
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Cloud / local deployment tools
- Environment configuration and automation scripts

> ⚠️ Note: This repository will evolve as more concepts are introduced and implemented.

## 📚 About the Course
This project is based on a DevOps crash course designed to **teach DevOps fast**, covering:

> Git & GitHub, CI/CD pipelines, Docker, Kubernetes, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and API deployment — everything needed to automate development and deployment workflows.

---

## 📈 Project Status
🚧 **In Progress**  
This is an active learning project. New features, configurations, and improvements will be added as I continue learning DevOps practices.

---

## 🤝 Why This Project Matters
This repository represents my **entry point into DevOps**, showing:
- Willingness to learn end-to-end systems
- Hands-on experimentation with real tools
- Growth from development into operations and automation
